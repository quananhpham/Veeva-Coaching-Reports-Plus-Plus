Coaching Reports Plus Plus is a coaching reports implementation that uses a combination of salesforce.com Approval Processes and VisualForce.  The main advantages of this implementation over configuration-only Coaching Reports implmentation are:
- Records are locked upon submission and cannot be unlocked or otherwise modified by either the rater or the rated employee.
- A rater who is not above the rated employee in the Role Hierarchy (as in the case where one District Manager filling in for another) may rate an employee and still retain visibility to the Coaching Report after submission.
